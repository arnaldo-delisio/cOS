# cOS Development Plan

## Current Status (May 2025)

### âœ… Completed Features
- **MediaPipe LLM Integration**: Gemma 3n AI model with <300ms response time
- **Modern Chat Interface**: WhatsApp-style conversation UI with dual input
- **Voice Recognition**: Vosk-powered speech-to-text
- **Text-to-Speech**: Natural voice responses
- **Basic Skills**: Calculator, file management, app launching (pattern matching)
- **Organized Project Structure**: Scripts, documentation, and code properly organized

### ðŸ”„ Current Focus
Building core conversational features as a regular Android app before transforming into a launcher.

## Development Strategy: App-First Approach

### Why App-First?
- **Lower Risk**: Test features without breaking user's home screen
- **Faster Iteration**: Quick development and testing cycles
- **User Trust**: Build confidence before launcher transformation
- **Gradual Adoption**: Users can increase usage over time

## Immediate Next Steps (Weeks 1-2)

### Phase 1: System Control Skills
- [ ] **WiFi Control**: "Turn on/off WiFi"
- [ ] **Bluetooth Control**: "Enable/disable Bluetooth"
- [ ] **Brightness Control**: "Set brightness to 50%"
- [ ] **Volume Control**: "Set volume to maximum"
- [ ] **Flashlight**: "Turn on flashlight"
- [ ] **Airplane Mode**: "Enable airplane mode"
- [ ] **Do Not Disturb**: "Turn on silent mode"

### Phase 2: Communication Skills  
- [ ] **SMS Sending**: "Text [contact] [message]"
- [ ] **Phone Calls**: "Call [contact]"
- [ ] **Contact Lookup**: "Show contact for John"
- [ ] **Recent Communications**: "Show recent calls"

### Phase 3: Utility Enhancement
- [ ] **Timer Functions**: "Set timer for 10 minutes"
- [ ] **Alarm Setting**: "Set alarm for 7 AM"
- [ ] **Quick Notes**: "Note: buy milk"
- [ ] **Reminders**: "Remind me to call dentist at 3 PM"
- [ ] **Enhanced Calculator**: More complex expressions

## Medium-Term Goals (Weeks 3-4)

### Performance & Polish
- [ ] Optimize AI response time to <200ms
- [ ] Improve voice recognition accuracy >95%
- [ ] Battery usage optimization
- [ ] Error handling and graceful fallbacks
- [ ] Offline mode for basic functions

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Context awareness across conversations
- [ ] Smart suggestions based on usage
- [ ] Integration with calendar and contacts
- [ ] Weather information
- [ ] Unit conversions

## Long-Term Vision (Month 2+)

### Launcher Transformation
- [ ] Home screen replacement option
- [ ] App drawer integration
- [ ] Widget support
- [ ] Migration wizard from app to launcher

### Deep Integration
- [ ] Accessibility service for app control
- [ ] Photo filtering with natural language
- [ ] Smart messaging routing by contact
- [ ] Cross-app workflows
- [ ] Preference learning engine

## Technical Implementation Priorities

### 1. System Control Skills (Current Priority)
Create `SystemControlSkill.kt` with:
```kotlin
class SystemControlSkill(private val context: Context) : ConversationalSkill() {
    // WiFi, Bluetooth, brightness, volume, flashlight controls
    // Permission handling for system settings
    // Clear feedback for each action
}
```

### 2. Permission Management
Add required permissions:
- `WRITE_SETTINGS` for system controls
- `MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS` for volume
- `CAMERA` for flashlight
- `SEND_SMS` for messaging
- `CALL_PHONE` for calling

### 3. Enhanced UI
- Loading states during AI processing
- Error message handling
- Settings screen for preferences
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

## Success Metrics

### Technical Goals
- AI response time: <200ms
- Voice accuracy: >95%
- Battery impact: <3%
- Crash rate: <0.1%
- Memory usage: <150MB

### User Experience Goals
- Zero learning curve
- Natural conversation flow
- Faster than traditional UI
- Reduces app hunting time
- Feels magical and helpful

## Release Timeline

### v0.1.0 - Conversational App (4-6 weeks)
- All system control skills working
- Reliable voice and text input
- Polished chat interface
- Basic utility functions

### v0.2.0 - Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks after v0.1.0)
- Communication skills
- Advanced utilities
- Performance optimizations
- User feedback integration

### v0.3.0 - Launcher Option (3-4 weeks after v0.2.0)
- Optional launcher mode
- Home screen replacement
- Migration tools
- Power user features

## Risk Mitigation

### Biggest Risks
1. **System permissions denied**: Provide clear explanations and fallbacks
2. **AI responses too slow**: Pre-load model, optimize prompts
3. **Voice recognition fails**: Always provide text input alternative
4. **Users find it confusing**: Clear onboarding and examples

### Mitigation Strategies
- Extensive testing on multiple devices
- Clear permission request explanations
- Graceful degradation for missing permissions
- Comprehensive error handling
- User feedback collection system

## Next Immediate Action

Start implementing `SystemControlSkill.kt` with WiFi toggle functionality as the first system control feature to demonstrate device integration capabilities.

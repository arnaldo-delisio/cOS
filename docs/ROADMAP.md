# cOS Development Roadmap - Unified Vision

## 🎯 Current Focus: v0.1.0 - Conversational App (May 2025)

### **Current Status**
- ✅ Modern chat interface with voice and text input
- ✅ MediaPipe LLM integration with Gemma 3n working
- ✅ Voice recognition and text-to-speech
- ✅ Basic conversational skills (calculator, file management)
- 🔄 Building as regular app first, launcher transformation later

### **Strategy: App-First Development**
Building core conversational features as a regular Android app before transforming into a launcher. This approach reduces risk and allows faster iteration.

### **Immediate Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)**
- [x] Complete chat interface implementation
- [x] MediaPipe AI integration working
- [ ] System control skills (WiFi, Bluetooth, brightness)
- [ ] Communication skills (SMS, calling)
- [ ] Performance optimization (<200ms AI response)

### **Core Features (Next 1-2 Months)**
- [ ] All system control capabilities working
- [ ] Reliable communication features
- [ ] Enhanced utility functions (timers, alarms, notes)
- [ ] Polished user experience with error handling

### **Launcher Transformation (Month 3)**
- [ ] Optional launcher mode
- [ ] Home screen replacement
- [ ] App drawer integration
- [ ] Migration wizard from app to launcher

## 🔧 Development Accelerators

### MediaPipe Integration
Using Google's MediaPipe LLM Inference API significantly accelerates development:
- **Pre-built GPU optimization** - No need to implement from scratch
- **Model deployment tools** - Simplified Gemma 3n integration
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in profiling capabilities

### Open Source Launcher References
Learning from successful launcher projects:
- **[Lawnchair](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair)** - Modern Pixel Launcher base
- **[Kvaesitso](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso)** - Search-focused launcher design
- **[Neo Launcher](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Launcher)** - Customization architecture

These resources reduce development time while maintaining cOS's unique conversational approach.

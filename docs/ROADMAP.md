## 🔧 Development Accelerators

### MediaPipe Integration
Using Google's MediaPipe LLM Inference API significantly accelerates development:
- **Pre-built GPU optimization** - No need to implement from scratch
- **Model deployment tools** - Simplified Gemma 3n integration
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in profiling capabilities

### Open Source Launcher References
Learning from successful launcher projects:
- **[Lawnchair](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair)** - Modern Pixel Launcher base
- **[Kvaesitso](https://github.com/MM2-0/Kvaesitso)** - Search-focused launcher design
- **[Neo Launcher](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Launcher)** - Customization architecture

These resources reduce development time while maintaining cOS's unique conversational approach.

# cOS - Adaptive Conversational Operating System

> **Transform any Android device into an adaptive, voice-first, privacy-respecting conversational experience that works the way YOU want.**

## 🌟 Vision

cOS is the world's first Adaptive Conversational OS that gives users the power to choose their interaction paradigm:
- **Classic Mode**: Traditional Android enhanced with voice commands
- **Widget Mode**: Revolutionary contextual interface with embedded widgets
- **Hybrid Mode**: Intelligent switching based on context

Built on proven open-source components, it offers a privacy-first alternative to Big Tech assistants with both voice and text-based interfaces for maximum accessibility.

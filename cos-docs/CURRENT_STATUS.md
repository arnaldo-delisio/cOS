# cOS Current Status - December 2024

## 📊 Project Health Summary

**Overall Status**: 🟡 **Active Development - Significant Work Required**

The cOS project has a solid foundation but requires substantial development to achieve the unified conversational experience outlined in our vision. The current implementation provides basic voice recognition and app control, but lacks the AI-powered intelligence and deep Android integration that defines our target architecture.

## 🔍 What We Have Today

### ✅ Working Foundation
- **Android App Structure**: Proper Kotlin/Compose project with Material Design 3
- **Voice Processing**: Vosk integration for on-device speech recognition
- **Basic Skills**: File management and app control through simple pattern matching
- **Permission System**: Proper Android permission handling
- **UI Framework**: Compose-based interface with theme system

### 🟡 Partially Implemented
- **Conversation Engine**: Basic framework exists but needs AI integration
- **Skill Architecture**: Modular system that can be extended for AI
- **Context Management**: Basic structure for conversation history
- **Voice Interface**: Works but needs integration with AI understanding

### ❌ Missing Core Components
- **Local AI Integration**: No Gemma 2B or LLM implementation
- **Deep Android Control**: Limited to basic app launching
- **Silent Learning**: No preference learning or adaptation
- **Unified Interface**: Current UI is basic development interface
- **Built-in Tools**: No PDF viewer, calculator, or notes functionality

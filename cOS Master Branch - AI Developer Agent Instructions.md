"Turn on airplane mode"
"Set brightness to 50%"  
"Connect to home WiFi"
"Enable do not disturb until 9am"
"Show battery status"
```

**Contact Management Skill:**
```kotlin
// Natural language contact operations
"Call mom"
"Text John that I'm running late"
"Show me contacts starting with A"
"Add new contact for Pizza Palace"
```

**Calendar Integration Skill:**
```kotlin
// Calendar operations through conversation
"What's on my calendar today?"
"Schedule meeting with team tomorrow at 2pm"
"Remind me to call doctor next week"
"Cancel my 3pm appointment"
```

**Web Search Skill:**
```kotlin
// Basic web search integration
"Search for best pizza near me"
"What's the weather in Paris?"
"Look up Python tutorial videos"
"Find news about Android 15"
```

#### 2.2 Advanced File Management
